## We are SPIRIT :earth_asia:  
**Team SPIRIT**. This is what we call ourselves. This is what we seek to embody.  
The name was coined on the *11th of August in 2020*, half in jest. And somehow, it just stuck.  
We are a small tight-knit group of a few independent developers and despite our size, we have garnered over **28k downloads** (and counting!) for both [Lazuli](https://github.com/TEAM-SPIRIT-Productions/Lazuli) and [SwordieDB](https://github.com/Bratah123/SwordieDB) combined.  

### :open_file_folder: Openness as an ideal
Openness. **Wikitionary** provides a pretty hefty explaination:  

> (The) degree of accessibility to view, use, and modify computer code in a shared environment 
> with legal rights generally held in common and preventing proprietary restrictions 
> on the right of others to continue viewing, using, modifying and sharing that code

**Team SPIRIT** firmly believes in the importance of *openness*.  
We see the open-source community as an invaluable vector for education and the advancement of computation techniques.  
This is why we offer a wide selection of open-source projects that seek to simplify computation through the medium of our choice: **MapleStory**.  

We hope that our projects can entice more people to take on programming through the use of our *favourite childhood game*.  
We will continue to offer more and more-varied MapleStory-related projects as a gateway into computing.  

### :computer: Modular computation
We offer various small modular projects which are compatible with other existing MapleStory-related projects, in hopes of enriching the community.  
We intend to take this as far as we can so that one day, anyone can simply pick and choose from a plethora of options, and mix-and-match to their hearts desire.
